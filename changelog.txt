Tiki Changelog
------------------

Changelog is now generated by a script (doc/devtools/release.php)

The following tags can be used to distinguish changes:
* [NEW] for additions of new features
* [ENH] is an enhancement; not really new but makes things work better (e.g. look and feel, performance...)
** [DOC] for improvements in the tips or contextual documentation provided to the user/admin

* [FIX] for bug fixes of any sort
** [SEC] for security fix operations. If you feel you have reason to put this tag, please first contact security at tiki.org.
* [UPD] for updates of third party/vendor libraries

* [UX] for user experience improvements; makes Tiki easier to use and understand (more details in https://dev.tiki.org/UX )

* [DB] for changes in the database

* [MOD] is a change which may be disruptive. For example, changing the default value of an option.
** [REM] for feature removals

* [REF] for refactoring; changes the structure of the code (to make it cleaner or clearer), without changing its actual behaviour.
** [KIL] for removals of unused or obsolete files. This tag was used in the sense of [REM] prior to Tiki 6.

* [REL] for the release process
* [MRG] for branch merges, generally performed by the merge scripts
* [TRA] for translation

When possible, it's also nice to indicate what feature is concerned by the change.
The tags info is also online: https://dev.tiki.org/Commit+Tags

Before 2.0, there was only [MOD] for both [ENH] and [MOD]:

[manually re-applied as it seems to have been reverted and svn thinks it's already been backported]

[bp/r70481][bp/r70444][FIX] maps: Various fixes, make the search and location buttons look like buttons, fix to my location for ol3 and fix removal of previous instances of a unique marker (like selection). 
[bp/r70445][ENH] maps: Clicking on a cluster zooms to the contents of the cluster (thanks marclaporte) - also refactor displayFeatureInfo and showPopup functions so they can be overridden by custom code if needs be 
[bp/r70452][ENH] maps: Add ZoomSlider and make coordinates work properly (although i'm not convinced that's really the right projection for our maps)
Also define them all before the map constructor instead of adding them afterwards. 
[bp/r70459][ENH] maps: Add 3rd party walkermatt/ol-layerswitcher to restore the layer switcher in ol3+ mode 
[bp/r70460][REF] maps: Move some big blocks of stubborn code still needing updating to ol3+ to the end of the file to they don't get forgotten about (completely) 
[bp/r70476][ENH] maps: Improve grouping of base and overlay layers in teh layer switcher. And allow tilesets to be grouped within one layer so you can have a map and labels combined in a single switchable map "layer"
e.g.
    tilesets="bing_road,stamen_watercolor~stamen_terrain-labels,nextzen~stamen_toner-labels" 
[bp/r70480][FIX] maps: jqueryTiki.mapTileSets is already an array so only split string values from the plugin tilesets parameter 
Also ran composer update with these automatic updates:
  - Updating blueimp/jquery-file-upload (v9.32.0 => v9.34.0)
  - Updating ckeditor/ckeditor (4.11.4 => 4.12.1)

[bp/r69779][FIX] When there are spaces in user names, the wrong user's information can be shown. For example, if there is "John Ace" and "John Doe" then it is possible John Ace's information will show when trying to view John Doe's. This is because $unifiedsearchlib->buildQuery uses filterContent which is a plaintext search for either of the terms, rather than filterIdentifier which searches for an exact match.

Also, fixed problem with the Vimeo wikiplugin not updating to show the uploaded video due to missing handling for the ticket.

Combined backport of listexecute improvements, mainly r68720 for using the correct field input for tracker fields but without the add/remove code from previous and subsequent commits. 
[bp/r68727][FIX] trackers: Fix select all checkbox on list (used in listexecute) 
[bp/r68941][bp/r68720][ENH] listexecute: Make the TrackerItemModify action use the correct input per field type instead of a plain text input. Tracker fetch_item_field action needed to be adapted to run without an existing Item - this possibly needs replicating in templates/wiki-plugins/wikiplugin_listexecute.tpl also.
Seems to work ok with most field types but more testing required before backporting (seems ok?)
