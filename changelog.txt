Tiki Changelog
------------------

Changelog is now generated by a script (doc/devtools/release.php)

The following tags can be used to distinguish changes:
* [NEW] for additions of new features
* [ENH] is an enhancement; not really new but makes things work better (e.g. look and feel, performance...)
* [DOC] for improvements in the tips or contextual documentation provided to the user/admin

* [FIX] for bug fixes of any sort
* [SEC] for security fix operations. If you feel you have reason to put this tag, please first contact security at tiki.org.
* [UPD] for updates of third party/vendor libraries

* [UX] for user experience improvements; makes Tiki easier to use and understand (more details in https://dev.tiki.org/UX )

* [DB] for changes in the database

* [MOD] is a change which may be disruptive. For example, changing the default value of an option.
* [REM] for feature removals

* [REF] for refactoring; changes the structure of the code (to make it cleaner or clearer), without changing its actual behaviour.
* [KIL] for removals of unused or obsolete files. This tag was used in the sense of [REM] prior to Tiki 6.

* [REL] for the release process
* [MRG] for branch merges, generally performed by the merge scripts
* [TRA] for translation

When possible, it's also nice to indicate what feature is concerned by the change.
The tags info is also online: https://dev.tiki.org/Commit+Tags

Before 2.0, there was only [MOD] for both [ENH] and [MOD]:
