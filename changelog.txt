Tiki Changelog
------------------

Changelog is now generated by a script (doc/devtools/release.php)

The following tags can be used to distinguish changes:
* [NEW] for additions of new features
* [ENH] is an enhancement; not really new but makes things work better (e.g. look and feel, performance...)
** [DOC] for improvements in the tips or contextual documentation provided to the user/admin

* [FIX] for bug fixes of any sort
** [SEC] for security fix operations. If you feel you have reason to put this tag, please first contact security at tiki.org.
* [UPD] for updates of third party/vendor libraries

* [UX] for user experience improvements; makes Tiki easier to use and understand (more details in https://dev.tiki.org/UX )

* [DB] for changes in the database

* [MOD] is a change which may be disruptive. For example, changing the default value of an option.
** [REM] for feature removals

* [REF] for refactoring; changes the structure of the code (to make it cleaner or clearer), without changing its actual behaviour.
** [KIL] for removals of unused or obsolete files. This tag was used in the sense of [REM] prior to Tiki 6.

* [REL] for the release process
* [MRG] for branch merges, generally performed by the merge scripts
* [TRA] for translation

When possible, it's also nice to indicate what feature is concerned by the change.
The tags info is also online: https://dev.tiki.org/Commit+Tags

Before 2.0, there was only [MOD] for both [ENH] and [MOD]:

[bp/r69827][FIX] sefurl: In some setups this tries to redeclare smarty_modifier_sefurl as smarty_modifier_sefUrl which causes an error. Also the 'wiki' type parameter isn't required as that is the default (and should be a string any way). 
[manually re-applied as it seems to have been reverted and svn thinks it's already been backported]

[bp/r70493][FIX] comments: Only apply AJAX loading js on the "reply", "edit" and "delete" buttons for comments. Version history links created by "save and commenting" were loading the file contents into the comment list and making a mess (thanks Guill)

[bp/r70444][FIX] maps: Various fixes, make the search and location buttons look like buttons, fix to my location for ol3 and fix removal of previous instances of a unique marker (like selection). 
[bp/r70445][ENH] maps: Clicking on a cluster zooms to the contents of the cluster (thanks marclaporte) - also refactor displayFeatureInfo and showPopup functions so they can be overridden by custom code if needs be 
[bp/r70452][ENH] maps: Add ZoomSlider and make coordinates work properly (although i'm not convinced that's really the right projection for our maps)
Also define them all before the map constructor instead of adding them afterwards. 
[bp/r70459][ENH] maps: Add 3rd party walkermatt/ol-layerswitcher to restore the layer switcher in ol3+ mode 
[bp/r70460][REF] maps: Move some big blocks of stubborn code still needing updating to ol3+ to the end of the file to they don't get forgotten about (completely) 
[bp/r70476][ENH] maps: Improve grouping of base and overlay layers in teh layer switcher. And allow tilesets to be grouped within one layer so you can have a map and labels combined in a single switchable map "layer"
e.g.
    tilesets="bing_road,stamen_watercolor~stamen_terrain-labels,nextzen~stamen_toner-labels" 
[bp/r70480][FIX] maps: jqueryTiki.mapTileSets is already an array so only split string values from the plugin tilesets parameter 
Also ran composer update with these automatic updates:
  - Updating blueimp/jquery-file-upload (v9.32.0 => v9.34.0)
  - Updating ckeditor/ckeditor (4.11.4 => 4.12.1)
  - Updating ezyang/htmlpurifier (v4.10.0 => v4.11.0)
  - Updating phpseclib/phpseclib (2.0.20 => 2.0.21)

[FIX]Removed unnecessary extra button in the profile applied which showed when the old profile code was shown with this new slideshow lib or plugin. In any case, former profile was cloned and updated to remove the code that produced extra link. In addition, reference to jqs5 is removed from the profile, since it's not longer valid info. Pending: discover how to show slide numbers in the footer of the slide, or remove that reference to that feature in the description of this profile. Congrats to all people involved in such a nice revammp of the slideshow feature! A-W-E-S-O-M-E :-)

[bp/r69773][ENH] objects: Make the search field for object selectors a pref so you can choose which field or fields to filter results by.
The default is "content" which will search in all fields defined in the pref unified_default_content, and respects field weightings set in unified_field_weight, other use cases require it to be "title" to only filter by the title which is what you see listed in the results.
Apologies for not making this a pref in the first place when i changed it to "content" in r68224.
This sort of reverts r69758, hope this is ok for you Nelson?

This is because $unifiedsearchlib->buildQuery uses filterContent which is a plaintext search for either of the terms, rather than filterIdentifier which searches for an exact match.

Also, fixed problem with the Vimeo wikiplugin not updating to show the uploaded video due to missing handling for the ticket.

[FIX][UI] Plugin Layout implements a full-width page by renaming div.container to div.container-fluid. But some page layouts have sections of the page with full-width backgrounds that hold content that is the standard container width, not full-width, do the div.containers that hold this content shouldn't be renamed. This commit adds a class ("container-std") to the standard container divs to limit Plugin Layout's renaming/widening to those divs and not affect the in-page container divs.
