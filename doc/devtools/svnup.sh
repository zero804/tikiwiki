#
# Purpose: Update your Tiki instance to the latest version of SVN.
# This is useful to have a test/development site always up to date.
# You should not use this in a production environment.
#
# This script is intended to be ran on a cron job with the following command:
# sh doc/devtools/svnup.sh
#
# You should also put the following line on a cron (to update your database): 
# php installer/shell.php
# 
# It's possible you may need to update your permissions with "sh setup.sh". 
# This is an interactive script so you need to set groups, etc to have in cron.
#
# If _htaccess is updated, you need to rename to .htaccess as well (or run sh htaccess.sh)
#
# To fully automate, you may also want to check the 
# Tiki Remote Instance Manage (TRIM), a combination 
# of shell and PHP scripts to install, update, backup, 
# restore and monitor (check security of) a large number 
# of Tiki installations (instances).
# http://doc.tiki.org/TRIM 
#
# TODO:
# Add option to run php installer/shell.php as well
# Make display of log an option

rm -f last.log
svn update > last.log

# uncomment the line below to see the list of all files updated. (ex.: if running manually)
# less last.log

exit 0
