That php bot uses SmartIRC for irc connection layer and 
Wollabot for bot behaviour and API. It uses php4 in CGI
mode, that you can use on command line or with exec().


Quick launch (unix only):
--------------------------
Edit wollabot.ini file and configure your server and channels
then execute : php4 start.php

Up to date documentation : http://tikiwiki.org/TikiBot

On channel irc.freenode.net you can talk with tiki, or at 
least one lesser aspect of its personality, named tikibot. 
He answers to some words preceded by an exclamation mark (!). 
You can say the command directly on the channel, Tikibot is 
listening, he will understand it's a command and will answer 
publicly on the channel. 

You can also send him commands in a more private way (and 
less disturbing for the channel), by using a /msg irc command. 
In such case he will answer by a private message.

As tikibot is still a nOOb, his tutors can tell him what to 
say, or how to act. Don't be surprised if tikibot says hello 
and smiles, he's sort of learning to be interactive.

Its vocabulary is limited to the following possible commands :

FAQ management
!faq something
/msg tikibot !faq something
Give out the learned definition of word something. One faq is 
maintained per channel. #tikiwiki is on http://tikiwiki.org/faq.txt

!learn something the definition of something (need op)
Teaches tikibot the definition of word something. You have to be 
op on the channel to do that.

!forget something (need op)
Make tikibot forget a definition. It's required if you want to change 
a term, you have to forget it first. Needs op rights on the channel.
