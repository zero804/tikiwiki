// Parameters:

// lang=xx    : only translates language 'xx',
//              if not given all languages are translated

// comments   : generate all comments (equal to close&module)

// close      : look for similar strings that are already translated and
//              generate a comment if a 'match' is made

// module     : generate comments that describe in which .php and/or .tpl
//              module(s) a certain string was found (useful for checking
//              translations in context)

// patch      : looks for the file 'language.patch' in the same directory
//              as the corresponding language.php and overrides any strings
//              in language.php - good if a user does not agree with
//              some translations or if only changes are sent to the maintainer

// spelling   : generates a file 'spellcheck_me.txt' that contains the
//              words used in the translation. It is then easy to check this
//              file for spelling errors (corrections must be done in
//              'language.php, however)

// groupwrite : Sets the generated files permissions to allow the generated
//              language.php also be group writable. This is good for
//              translators if they do not have root access to tiki but
//              are in the same group as the webserver. Please remember
//              to have write access removed when translation is finished
//              for security reasons. (Run script again without this
//              parameter)

// Examples:
// http://www.neonchart.com/get_strings.php?lang=sv
// Will translate language 'sv' and (almost) avoiding comment generation

// http://www.neonchart.com/get_strings.php?lang=sv&comments
// Will translate language 'sv' and generate all possible comments.
// This is the most usefull mode when working on a translation.

// http://www.neonchart.com/get_strings.php?lang=sv&nohelp&nosections
// These options will only provide the minimal amout of comments.
// Usefull mode when preparing a translation for distribution.

// http://www.neonchart.com/get_strings.php?nohelp&nosections
// Prepare all languages for release


// ### Note for translators about translation of text ending with punctuation
// ###
// ### The current list of concerned punctuation can be found in 'lib/init/tra.php'
// ### On 2009-03-02, it is: (':', '!', ';', '.', ',', '?')
// ### For clarity, we explain here only for colons: ':' but it is the same for the rest
// ###
// ### Short version: it is not a problem that string "Login:" has no translation. Only "Login" needs to be translated.
// ###
// ### Technical justification:
// ### If a string ending with colon needs translating (like "{tr}Login:{/tr}")
// ### then Tiki tries to translate 'Login' and ':' separately.
// ### This allows to have only one translation for "{tr}Login{/tr}" and "{tr}Login:{/tr}"
// ### and it still allows to translate ":" as "&nbsp;:" for languages that
// ### need it (like french)

$lang=Array(
// ### Start of unused words
// ### Please remove manually!
